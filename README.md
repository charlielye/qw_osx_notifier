# QuakeWorld OS X Player Notifications

Simple script to display notifications in OS X as new players join servers.

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/charlielye/qw_osx_notifier.git ~/.qwplayers`.
2. Add servers in `~/.qwplayers/qwservers` (if necessary).
3. Execute `~/.qwplayers/run`, perferably on startup.

To check who's currently playing you can run `~/.qwplayers/status`. I've aliased it with `alias qwp='~/.qwplayers/status'` in `.bashrc`.

Never miss a QW game again!
